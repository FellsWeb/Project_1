# N.O.W. (Network of Outspokenness Worldwide) 

N.O.W. not only seeks to provide our users with awareness of the vast amount of social issues that impact our society daily, but also provide the tools necessary to get involved. Users have the ability to search various social causes/issues. Users can gain knowledge and awareness through articles retrieved from their search. If the user has further interest in getting involved, they have the ability to search groups and events, as well as the ability to create groups and events if they want to start a new movement!
